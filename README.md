This project allows to make an addition of two numbers entered to the form on html page and shows result on the same page.

The GET request from the html form is sent to api uses php 5.5.9 and ajax reuest. If data is in a numerical format, it returns a sum of numbers, otherwise corresponding errors are shown. The result is then shown on the same html page.

Unittests are written in Python 2.7.6 to check for: correct calculation result, correct input format and request type (only GET is allowed). To execute tests a requests==2.2.1 library is required.
